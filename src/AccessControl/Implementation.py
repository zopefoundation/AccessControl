"""Controller that can switch between security machinery implementations.

This module allows configuration of the security implementation after
the initial import of the modules.  It is intended to allow runtime
selection of the machinery based on Zope's configuration file.

The helper function defined here switches between the 'C' and 'PYTHON'
security implementations by loading the appropriate implementation
module and wiring the implementation into the other modules of the
AccessControl package that defined the various components before this
module was introduced.
